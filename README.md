# Univariate-Linear-Regression

Linear Regression with NumPy and Python.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Linear Regression with NumPy and Python is divided into the following tasks:

### Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries
### Task 2: Load the Data and Libraries
### Task 3: Visualize the Data
### Task 4: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)
### Task 5: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python
### Task 6: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)
### Task 7: Plotting the Convergence
### Task 8: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
### Task 9: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
